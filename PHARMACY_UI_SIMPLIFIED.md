# Pharmacy UI - Simplified & Corrected ‚úÖ

## What I Fixed

You were absolutely right! I overbuilt the pharmacy UI with patient-facing features. Here's what I removed:

### ‚ùå Removed (Patient Features)
1. **PriceBreakdownCard component** - Deleted entirely
2. **Calculate Price button** - Removed from order detail
3. **Confirm Order button** - Removed from order detail  
4. **calculateOrderPrice() method** - Removed from service
5. **confirmOrder() method** - Removed from service
6. **Price breakdown display** - Removed from order detail page

### ‚úÖ Kept (Pharmacy Features)
1. **Order list** - View all orders with status
2. **Order detail** - See order information
3. **Mark Ready for Dispatch** - When order is dispensed and paid
4. **Track Dispatch** - When order is out for delivery
5. **OTP Verification** - For delivery confirmation
6. **Re-dispatch** - When dispatch fails
7. **Cancel Dispatch** - When dispatch is booked/assigned

## Simplified Pharmacy Flow

### What Pharmacist Does:
1. **Create Order** (from chat) - Set medication price only
2. **Wait** - Patient sees price breakdown in mobile app
3. **See CONFIRMED** - Patient confirmed in mobile app
4. **Mark as Dispensed** - When ready to prepare
5. **Mark Ready for Dispatch** - When prepared and paid
6. **Track Delivery** - Monitor dispatch status

### What Patient Does (Mobile App):
1. **View Price Breakdown** - See total with fees
2. **Confirm Order** - Accept the total price
3. **Pay** - Complete payment
4. **Track Delivery** - Follow dispatch
5. **Enter OTP** - Confirm delivery

## Current Pharmacy UI Actions

### Order Detail Page Actions:
- **PENDING**: No actions (waiting for patient)
- **CONFIRMED**: Mark as Dispensed
- **DISPENSED**: Mark Ready for Dispatch (if paid)
- **OUT_FOR_DELIVERY**: Track Dispatch, OTP Verification
- **FAILED/CANCELED**: Re-dispatch
- **BOOKED/ASSIGNED**: Cancel Dispatch

### Status Badges:
- **PENDING**: Yellow (waiting for patient)
- **CONFIRMED**: Blue (ready to dispense)
- **DISPENSED**: Green (ready for dispatch)
- **OUT_FOR_DELIVERY**: Purple (in transit)
- **DELIVERED**: Green (completed)

## Clean & Simple

The pharmacy UI is now focused on **pharmacy responsibilities only**:

‚úÖ **View orders**  
‚úÖ **Dispense medication**  
‚úÖ **Track deliveries**  
‚úÖ **Manage dispatch**  

‚ùå **NOT responsible for:**
- Price calculations (backend does this)
- Order confirmations (patient does this)
- Payment processing (mobile app does this)

## Ready for Testing

The pharmacy UI now supports the correct flow:
1. Create order (medication price only)
2. Wait for patient confirmation
3. Dispense when confirmed
4. Mark ready for dispatch
5. Track delivery status

**Much cleaner and focused on pharmacy duties!** üéØ
