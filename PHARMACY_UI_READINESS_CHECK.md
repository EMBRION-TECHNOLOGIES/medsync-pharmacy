## ⚠️ What's NOT in Pharmacy UI (Mobile App Only)

These features are handled by the **patient mobile app**, not the pharmacy web:

1. **Patient Payment**: 
   - Mobile app handles payment via Paystack
   - Pharmacy UI just sees the result

2. **Real-time Tracking (Patient View)**:
   - Mobile app shows tracking map/live updates
   - Pharmacy UI shows status updates, not map

3. **Patient-facing OTP**:
   - Mobile app prompts patient to enter OTP
   - Pharmacy UI has OTP verification for pharmacists

---

## 🎯 Can You Follow the Testing Guide?

### YES! Here's How:

### Phase 1-3: Order Creation → View → Mark Ready ✅
```
Pharmacy Web Flow:
1. Go to /chat → See patient conversations
2. Patient uploads prescription → Auto order created
3. Go to /orders → See new order
4. Click order → View details
5. Click "Mark Ready for Dispatch"
6. ✅ Status updates in real-time
```

### Phase 4: Track Dispatch Status ✅
```
Pharmacy Web Flow:
1. View order detail page
2. See dispatch status badge (BOOKED → ASSIGNED → etc.)
3. See timeline events updating
4. See tracking number and URL
5. Click tracking URL to open Kwik tracking
```

### Phase 5-6: OTP & History ✅
```
Pharmacy Web Flow:
1. When IN_TRANSIT: "Confirm Delivery (OTP)" button appears
2. Click button → Enter 6-digit OTP
3. Delivery confirmed → Status becomes DELIVERED
4. View complete timeline showing all events
```

## 🔧 Minor Gaps (Not Critical)

### 1. **Payment Status Display**
- **Status**: Needs enhancement
- **Current**: Basic paymentStatus badge
- **Could add**: More detailed payment info (amount, method, receipt)

### 2. **Dispatch Map View**
- **Status**: Not in scope
- **Current**: Shows tracking URL (opens external Kwik page)
- **Mobile app**: Has built-in map view
- **Why not needed**: Pharmacist doesn't need map (patient does)

### 3. **Driver Information Display**
- **Status**: Depends on backend response
- **Expected**: Dispatch object should include driver info
- **Current**: Shows provider, tracking, ETA
- **Could add**: Driver name, phone, vehicle details

---

## ✅ Ready for Testing Guide?

**YES - 100% Ready!**

### What Works Right Now:
1. ✅ Chat interface for prescriptions
2. ✅ Orders list with filters
3. ✅ Order detail with full information
4. ✅ Mark Ready action
5. ✅ Re-dispatch action
6. ✅ Cancel dispatch action
7. ✅ OTP verification
8. ✅ Real-time socket updates
9. ✅ Timeline with all events
10. ✅ Dispatch tracking details

### What to Test:
Follow the testing guide **exactly as written**. The pharmacy UI supports all required actions.

**Note**: The guide mentions "Pharmacist creates order from quote" - this is **automatic** by the backend, so you don't need to do anything. Just view the order in `/orders` and proceed with "Mark Ready".
